*** VirLaDEE-Workshop

This project combines state-of-the-art VR technology and User interaction. The aim is to create a multiuser environment that other users can access remotely.


VirLaDEE seeks to provide digital twins of physical engineering laboratories that will be accessible via a cutting-edge web platform. Modern virtual technologies will be used to give high-quality, inclusive engineering education through these virtual lab facilities, which will act as a playground to enhance the current teaching strategies. 

The digital strategy encompasses a range of activities the European Commission promotes. Its main objectives are to modernize education throughout the EU, increase training in digital skills, and employ digital technology for education. From an educational standpoint, having access to a lab setting where a variety of resources may be utilised, displayed, and tested is frequently necessary when teaching engineering-related subjects like robotics and automation. But more than 1.5 billion kids are now compelled to stay at home due to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, using the internet and other digital tools to obtain instruction and learning. 

While teaching theoretical lectures online can be done without too many problems, e-learning platforms like Teams and Zoom are not yet enough to substitute in-person instruction and hands-on practice in actual laboratories. While some online platforms, like Autodesk Tinker CAD for 3D and circuit design, offer engineering tools, they don't replicate an immersive physical engineering lab and lack material on many topics, such as automation and robot control. 

This project summons a cooperation between Southern Denmark University (SDU), Denmark The SDU Technology Entrepreneurship and Invention (TEI) division expands on the traditional perspective by taking into account the boundary-crossing and multidisciplinary nature of invention from Engineering to Business. Research and teaching in this area explore several stages of the innovation process. 


Estonia's Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) Product development, production engineering, industrial engineering and management, transportation engineering and logistics, materials science, metal processing, and technology of other engineering materials are all covered by TalTech's Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (DMIE).

Italian organisation Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche â€“ STIIMA (CNR-STIIMA). Promoting industrial innovation, CNR-STIIMA carries out key actions in scientific research and technological development for the manufacturing industries in Italy and Europe, ensuring their competitiveness and sustainability.
